# hello-in-hand手语“你好”翻译模型
机器学习课设做着玩的  model为已经训练好的模型，检测方式是运行detect.py文件  引用请标注地址或者给个星星谢谢  有能力的可以尝试拓展，框架已经给好了

This is a machine learning course project that I did for fun. It's my first time uploading to GitHub, so please forgive any imperfections.  
The model is already trained. To perform detection, simply run the detect.py file.  
If you cite this work, please indicate the source or leave a star, thank you!  
Those who are capable can try to expand upon it; the framework has already been provided.
